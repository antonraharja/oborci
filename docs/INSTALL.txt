4. Knowing the path of oborci-source (will refer it as SOURCE)


STEP BY STEP INSTALLATION
-------------------------

1. Setup your CI on your DOCROOT
        - Place SYSTEM outside DOCROOT if possible
2. Copy the content of SOURCE to DOCROOT
        - Copy only the content of SOURCE
        - The copy process will replace several files
3. Edit DOCROOT/index.php and set $system_path to SYSTEM
4. Edit DOCROOT/application/config/config.php
        - Please take note on $config['base_url'] and $config['index_page']
        - Set base_url if you have to
        - Set index_page to index.php if you don't use clean URL mod_rewrite
        - Set other options too if you have to
5. Create a database (or use existing database), for example: myapps
6. Insert SQL statements from DOCROOT/docs/db/db.sql to database
        - In this example you will need to insert it to database myapps
7. Edit DOCROOT/application/config/database.php
        - Change the database connection configuration
8. Edit DOCROOT/application/config/autoload.php
        - Add your autoloaded libraries, helpers or anything you need
        - Oborci requires database, session and oborci/Oborci_Model autoloaded
        - Also requires url and oborci/translate helpers autoloaded
9. When all OK, you can browse url point to your DOCROOT

Please note that only files under directory oborci, or have oborci word in their
name are Oborci related files. Others included in this package are examples.

You can change, modify, replace or even remove those example files.
